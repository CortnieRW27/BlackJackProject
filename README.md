# BlackJackProject




# Description

I started this program out by asking the user if they would like to play the game of BlackJack. If they chose to play the game the method playTheGame was called and an initial hand was given. The rules for the user was in accordance to the BlackJack rules. The rules for the dealer were instructed in the homework prompt, to use the "rule of 17". I started out trying to make three different methods, one for the players choice, one for the dealers choice, and one for the winning logic. I, however, could not get the program to run the way it needed to be ran by doing it this way. I decided to change my approach and make one method for the entire game, choices and all. I worked hard on all the different aspects of this assignment to try and fully understand what has been taught to me up until this point. I took the advice of, writing a little code and running it to check my progress. I commented in every method to keep track of it's purpose and found it highly beneficial. 



# Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Chrome
- Git Hub
- BlackJack references



# Lessons Learned

- Using comments to help guide my process
- Doing very small steps and testing my written code along the way
- Using a white board and/or paper to write graphs and code in English
- Understanding the variable names are just a reference to an object on the heap and not what "holds the variable"
- Learned more about methods (but still have much more learning to do!)
- Tried my best to "recall" information and lessons learned without looking things up (if I got too suck I would refer back to notes and recordings, but ultimately wanted to try and not get as much help this week)
- Gained a better understanding of abstract classes and methods 
- A better understanding on method calls from different classes
- The TA helped me understand dot notation better and what it's doing (this was very helpful)
